    <id>http://mkmurray.com/blog/2012/12/01/async-lambda-expressions-and-anonymous-delegates</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've known about the new <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords in C# 5 for a while now,
but I saw a use of it I hadn't anticipated. I saw Jon Skeet create an
asyncronous lambda expression and was caught a bit off guard. After thinking
about it, it really isn't that amazing, but I thought I would spread the word
anyway because I think it could be a really handy feature.</p>

<p>Anonymous functions are declared without a method name and can be passed around
and invoked at will. Lambda expression syntax creates anonymous functions that
can be used as delegates or expression trees. In C# 5, you can adorn functions
with the <code>async</code> keyword which signifies that the function will return a <code>Task</code>
object from the Task Parallel Library as a return value. You will also find
somewhere in the method body the keyword <code>await</code> next to a statement that could
take a while to process and be a blocking operation. Now your method can resume
operation after the asyncronous operation has completed and has its result.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example:</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
    public void ButtonClick()
    {
        ProcessFiles();
    }

    private async void ProcessFiles()
    {
        var files = new string[] { "file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt" };

        foreach (var file in files)
        {
            var fileContents = await ReadTextAsync(file);
            // likely do something with file contents
        }
    }

    private async Task&lt;string&gt; ReadTextAsync(string filePath)
    {
        // Some text reading implementation that supports the TPL
    }
</pre>


<p>The button click handler method would return at the first sign of a blocking
operation and callback delegates are set up under the covers by the compiler to
finish executing the rest of the code after the blocking process finishes.</p>

<p>Here is the same example but using an async lambda expression:</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
    public void ButtonClick()
    {
        var files = new string[] { "file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt" };

        files.ForEach(async file => await ReadTextAsync(file));
    }

    private async Task&lt;string&gt; ReadTextAsync(string filePath)
    {
        // Some text reading implementation that supports the TPL
    }
</pre>


<p>Please overlook my disregard of single responsibility and encapsulation, and so
on so forth. This is an overly simplified example intended solely to show what
the syntax looks like. Either way, I could see this lighter weight syntax coming
in handy in the future.</p>

<p>In the same example where I saw async lambda syntax used, I also saw Jon Skeet
show off a really clever extension method that took an enumerable collection of
<code>Task</code> objects and reordered them so they could be enumerated and handled in the
order that they complete their asynchronous operations. Perhaps I will show that
piece of code next time.</p>

<p>I was having fun working on the <a href="http://toughestdeveloperpuzzleever.com/tdpe2/">Toughest Developer Puzzle Ever 2</a> when I came across a problem that asked for the coordinates into a grid of numbers of the upper left corner for a 4x4 sub-grid with a magic sum of 34, meaning all rows, columns, and the 2 diagonals all sum up to 34.&#160; Instead of trying to figure it out manually, I probably did what many programmers would do and wrote a quick and dirty program to accomplish the task for me.</p>  <p>I didn’t try to use any optimized search algorithm or anything, as I knew that the problem space was very small and specific and that computers are really fast.&#160; So I figured I would just write a brute-force iterate through every row and column type of an algorithm (in Big O notation being <font face="Courier New">O(mn)</font> or just <font face="Courier New">O(n<span style="font-size:xx-small; vertical-align:top;">2</span>)</font> if the original grid is square), knowing it would return in milliseconds.</p>  <p>I quickly realized that each iteration was not dependent any previous iteration for its calculations, so I decided it might be a good time to try out the new <font face="Courier New">Parallel.For</font> loops in the .NET 4 Framework that would multi-thread the iterations of the loops.&#160; Here’s the implementation I threw together:</p> <span class="fullpost">   <pre class="brush: csharp">using System;

<p>Nothing special and certainly did the job.&#160; I didn’t really notice a performance improvement in anyway, but that was expected for such a small problem.&#160; I don’t really expect a whole lot of feedback on such straightforward code, but if there is a cleaner or more efficient way to utilize <font face="Courier New">Parallel.For</font> or <font face="Courier New">Parallel.ForEach</font>, please don’t hesitate to let me know via commenting to this post.&#160; Thanks!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<p>Many .NET developers are aware of the idea of partial Classes, as they have existed since .NET 2.0.&#160; The primary purpose is to allow you the developer to share claim on a C# Class with Visual Studio's automated code generators (mainly used by the many designers included in Visual Studio), without the automated code generator stomping all over your code additions every time it runs.&#160; For instance, in a Windows Forms application, you get a code-behind Class where you can put your logic, properties, methods, and event handlers; it is a partial Class of the one Visual Studio's Windows Form designer creates and manages for all the UI objects you dragged around in the designer.&#160; A good summarization of this feature is given by <a title="Bart De Smet&#39;s Blog" href="http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/default.aspx">Bart De Smet</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>&quot;In short, partial classes allow you to split the definition of a class across multiple files, or alternatively you could think about it as a code compilation unit separated over multiple files.&quot;</p> </blockquote>  <p>As another practical application of this feature, I have occasionally implemented a practice using partial Classes that I learned from a previous coworker.&#160; Occasionally you find yourself with a Class that is inescapably large.&#160; Perhaps it is a web service that has been in use for a while by customers or other groups within your company, and you can't just deprecate the service very easily; so you just keep extending it and adding more web methods to it for additional, similar functionality.&#160; Another potential situation could be that you began designing a simple application all in one file but it grew to be a little bigger than expected, but it doesn't quite merit a whole major redesign into appropriate classes.&#160; I know how this all sounds, but these scenarios aren't exactly uncommon in real-world practice, where there are other factors in consideration.&#160; I suppose many would resort to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9a1ybwek.aspx">C# <font face="Courier New">regions</font></a>, but I'm not a fan of them as it really only gives the illusion that your code file is better grouped and somehow shorter.</p> <span class='fullpost'> <p>So if you need some decent semblance of organization in a messy class file with little effort, the partial Class feature can come to your rescue.&#160; You can basically create a partial Class file for each grouping of code that you would probably be putting in a C# <font face="Courier New">region</font>.&#160; For instance, a relatively small Windows Form application could be broken up into the following sub-files (all partial Classes of the same <font face="Courier New">MainForm</font> class):</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>MainForm.cs</strong> = contains the constructor and a few rare global enumerations, properties, or sub-classes </li>    <li><strong>MainForm.UI.cs</strong> = contains the event handlers and other supporting methods that interact directly with the UI </li>    <li><strong>MainForm.Processing.cs</strong> = contains the application logic designed to be spun off in a separate worker thread in order to keep the UI thread from blocking while waiting </li>    <li><strong>MainForm.Designer.cs</strong> = the auto-generated UI file from the Windows Form designer </li> </ul>  <p>Obviously you should try to architect your code better from the get-go, but perhaps what you are looking at is legacy code you have inherited from previous developers and the deadline is fast approaching.&#160; There are reasonable circumstances I can think of (and have encountered) where this quick &amp; dirty organization lets you keep an ounce of sanity, so that you can keep moving forward.</p> </span>  </div>

<p>I ran into a problem with trying to spawn off a process to launch an <font face="Courier New">MSIExec.exe</font> command from C#.&#160; I wanted to launch the process and then wait for it to finish before proceeding; however,&#160; it was always returned immediately before the install or uninstall was really finished.&#160; I confirmed this behavior with this blog entry:&#160; <a title="http://blogs.msdn.com/heaths/archive/2005/11/15/493236.aspx" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/heaths/archive/2005/11/15/493236.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/heaths/archive/2005/11/15/493236.aspx</a></p>  <p>The author suggests &quot;<font face="Courier New">start /wait</font>&quot; which works from the command line or a batch file.&#160; I did verify it works launching a batch file or two from C#, but I preferred to keep in C# as much as possible.&#160; Also, I was trying to accomplish a silent background process running the <font face="Courier New">MSIExec</font> commands.&#160; However, C# can't just start a process calling &quot;<font face="Courier New">start</font>,&quot; which is an internal command to the Command Prompt I guess.</p>  <p>Someone reminded me on a message board that you can start a process using <font face="Courier New">CMD.exe</font>, calling &quot;<font face="Courier New">start</font>&quot; like this:</p> <span class='fullpost'> <p><pre class="code"><span style="color: #2b91af">ProcessStartInfo </span>startInfo = <span style="color: blue">new </span><span style="color: #2b91af">ProcessStartInfo</span>(
    <span style="color: #a31515">&quot;cmd.exe&quot;</span>,
    <span style="color: blue">string</span>.Format(<span style="color: #a31515">&quot;/c start /MIN /wait msiexec.exe /x {0} /quiet&quot;</span>, guid));
startInfo.WindowStyle = <span style="color: #2b91af">ProcessWindowStyle</span>.Hidden;

<span style="color: #2b91af">Process </span>process = <span style="color: #2b91af">Process</span>.Start(startInfo);
process.WaitForExit();</pre></p> <p>It works like a charm.&#160; I don't think you even need the &quot;<font face="Courier New">/MIN</font>&quot; flag for &quot;<font face="Courier New">start</font>&quot; anyway.</p>

You could use process.WaitForExit() isn&#39;t it?</div>
