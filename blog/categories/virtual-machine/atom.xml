<p><a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a> provides a free utility that can clone physical machines into a VMWare virtual machine; it can also convert other vendors' VM formats into the VMWare format.&#160; I can think of so many uses for this very handy tool.&#160; It has a very simple and easy user interface that walks you through the steps.&#160; Here is a link to the product:</p>  <p><a title="http://www.vmware.com/products/converter/" href="http://www.vmware.com/products/converter/">http://www.vmware.com/products/converter/</a></p>  <p><u>One important note</u>:&#160; When you are specifying the name and destination of the resultant VM image, the location must be in UNC format (i.e., <font face="Courier New">\\machinename\share</font>).&#160; The thing that got me, though, was that it will give you an uninformative error if you leave a trailing backslash ('\') at the end of the UNC path, saying something like it couldn't connect to the share for some reason.&#160; Just remove the last slash and you'll be good to go.</p>  </div>

<p>So I have been tackling a build problem with some humongous deployment builds in Visual Studio.&#160; In reality, VS Deployment Projects are not ideal for even slightly sophisticated MSI installers; but we've gone far enough down this path that we can't make the switch at the moment.&#160; So please choose something with more control like the <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/">Microsoft-sponsored open-source project WiX</a> or a well-established, paid product like <a href="http://www.acresso.com/products/installation/installshield.htm">InstallShield</a>.</p>  <p>So the error I kept getting was &quot;<font face="Courier New">Not enough storage is available to complete this operation</font>&quot; and it would list some file (not the same every time).&#160; It appears the error means the build process ran out of virtual memory or something.&#160; So I found something interesting about default limit of 2 GB for any Windows process and how to raise that limit.&#160; That process is discussed in this post:&#160; <a title="http://murrayon.net/2007/12/building-monster-vs-2005-or-2008.html" href="http://murrayon.net/2007/12/building-monster-vs-2005-or-2008.html">http://murrayon.net/2007/12/building-monster-vs-2005-or-2008.html</a></p> <span class='fullpost'> <p>Well, it has worked on one guy's laptop this whole time and it only worked for about 2 days on my machine (then it started getting an error that said &quot;<font face="Courier New">Unrecoverable build error</font>&quot; and was accompanied with a &quot;<font face="Courier New">Send Error Report</font>&quot; dialog).&#160; I also tried the fix on like 3 other machines without any success at all (in fact many of the machines become highly unstable with the <font face="Courier New">3GB</font> Windows boot switch).&#160; So for 6 months, I couldn't figure out why it would work on that one machine and none of the others.&#160; Well, just recently that guy's laptop joined the domain and started using a domain user account (I have no clue why he wasn't from the beginning, but I digress).&#160; His machine didn't become unstable, but it did quit building our monster deployment build.&#160; We thought we were up a creek with no box to build the MSI installer and a deadline fast approaching.&#160; We got it working on his laptop by going back to a local user account.</p>  <p>Well, that got me thinking about how we could get another PC to be able to do the darn build.&#160; I tried the build on my PC with just a local user account, but that didn't work because I don't currently have the other fix named above.&#160; So I created a virtual machine (in case things got unstable again) and didn't add it to the domain, just to be safe.&#160; I did the fix named above, and am now able to successfully build this MSI install consistently under a local user account without getting the &quot;<font face="Courier New">Not enough storage is available</font>&quot; error message.&#160; The details of this adventure are discussed in this post:&#160; <a title="http://murrayon.net/2007/12/build-error-when-building-very-large-vs.html" href="http://murrayon.net/2007/12/build-error-when-building-very-large-vs.html">http://murrayon.net/2007/12/build-error-when-building-very-large-vs.html</a></p>  <p>Maybe in a few months we'll move this installer build process to WiX and avoid the inflexibility we are running into with Visual Studio Deployment Projects.</p> </span>  </div>

I was running into the same 'Unrecoverable build error' when trying to build a VS2008 deployment project. Tried all of the fixes you mentioned - regsrv32, MSDN knowledge base fixes, etc. Nothing worked. Then just on a hunch I went into the $User\AppData\Local\Temp directory and noticed that there were about 6GB of temp files there. Deleted those, and bingo - working build!</div>
